      <p class="yu-p">"Each of us has enormous potential. We are born with unlimited capacity, but we often remain unaware of it because the systems we create limit our abilities. Poverty is not inherent; it is artificially imposed by flawed institutions, policies, and systems. If we can create a world where everyone has equal opportunities, where no one is excluded, and where economic systems are designed to serve humanity rather than profit alone, we can eradicate poverty and unlock the potential of millions of people. This is not charity, but empowerment, enabling people to live with dignity and hope."</p>
